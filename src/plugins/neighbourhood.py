"""
src/plugins/neighbourhood.py â€” Neighbourhood density model plugin: fast phoneme-level edit-distance-1 neighbor counting.

Counts words whose phoneme sequence differs by one insertion, deletion or substitution of a phoneme.

Notes:
- All edit operations are at the phoneme level (not character).
- If your corpus encodes a single phoneme as multiple characters, each space-delimited phoneme string is treated as one atomic symbol.
  For correct behavior, ensure each token is a list of phoneme strings.
